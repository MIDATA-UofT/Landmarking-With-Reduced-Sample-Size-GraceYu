## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### 10%
```{r, fig.height=2}
validation <- read_csv("./validation/10%.csv")
glimpse(validation)

# Summary table
validation %>%
  dplyr::select(All, Femur, Patella, QT)%>%
  summarize(n=n(), 
            value = c("mean", "median"),
            AP = c(mean(All), median(All)),
            Femur = c(mean(Femur), median(Femur)),
            Patella = c(mean(Patella), median(Patella)),
            QT = c(mean(QT), median(QT)))
```


Use R to find a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the *mean*.  Use 1000 bootstrap samples. *NOTE:* More bootstrap samples is better, but if you find this times out or takes too long in RStudio Cloud, try using 1000 bootstrap samples instead.

```{r}
repetitions <- 1000
All_means <- rep(NA, repetitions)  # where we'll store the bootstrap means
Femur_means <- rep(NA, repetitions)  # where we'll store the bootstrap means
Patella_means <- rep(NA, repetitions)  # where we'll store the bootstrap means
QT_means <- rep(NA, repetitions)  # where we'll store the bootstrap means
sample_size <- as.numeric(validation %>% summarize(n()))
set.seed(50)
for (i in 1:repetitions)
{
  boot_samp <- validation %>% sample_n(size = sample_size, replace=TRUE)
  All_means[i] <- as.numeric(boot_samp %>% summarize(mean(All)))
  Femur_means[i] <- as.numeric(boot_samp %>% summarize(mean(Femur)))
  Patella_means[i] <- as.numeric(boot_samp %>% summarize(mean(Patella)))
  QT_means[i] <- as.numeric(boot_samp %>% summarize(mean(QT)))
}
quantile(All_means,c(0.025,0.975))
quantile(Femur_means,c(0.025,0.975))
quantile(Patella_means,c(0.025,0.975))
quantile(QT_means,c(0.025,0.975))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
