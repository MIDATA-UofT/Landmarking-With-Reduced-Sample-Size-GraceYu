# Landmarking-With-Reduced-Sample-Size-GraceYu
This project involves training two machine leaarning algorithms: Unbiased-Teacher (semi-supervised) and YOLOv5 (supervised) on MSK ultrasound images for knees. We compared the model performance with AP matrix and IoU. 

## Results
The summary tables and figures can be found in file 

## Images
Images were collected from MiDATA Lab. Visualization of predictions on images can be found in directory "visualization".
