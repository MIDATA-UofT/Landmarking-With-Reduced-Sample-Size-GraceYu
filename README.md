# Landmarking-With-Reduced-Sample-Size-GraceYu
This project involves training two machine leaarning algorithms: Unbiased-Teacher (semi-supervised) and YOLOv5 (supervised) on MSK ultrasound images for knees. We compared the model performance with AP matrix and IoU. 

## Training
The raw data generated during training models can be found in directory "Code_and_Raw_Data". 

## Results
The summary tables and figures can be found in file final_report_figures.xlsx.

## Images
Images were collected from MiDATA Lab. Visualization of predictions on images can be found in directory "visualization".

## License
Codes from Unbiased-Teacher is used under MIT license, and codes from YOLOv5 is under GNU general public license, pleaase check LICENSE for details.
